fixes:
  - Core Library's init scripts used to have various problems detecting
    pre-installed (by DIB) murano-agent on non-ubuntu images.
    Agent setup script now checks wider list of directories before attempting
    to install murano-agnet and service script now does not impose strict script
    location.
