features:
  - Basic reflection capabilities were added to MuranoPL. Now it is possible
    to get type info with typeinfo() function and using it as a starting point
    obtain information about the class, its methods and properties as well as
    the package of the class. Reflected properties can be used to obtain or
    set its value in a given object or invoke its method.
