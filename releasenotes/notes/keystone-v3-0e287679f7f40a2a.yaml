fixes:
  - Removed the need for Keystone v2 options (admin_user,
    admin_password, admin_tenant_name) when Keystone v3
    is in use.
  - Previously murano assumed that the service user
    and service project are in the 'Default' domain. These values can
    now be set in ``keystone_authtoken`` config group.
