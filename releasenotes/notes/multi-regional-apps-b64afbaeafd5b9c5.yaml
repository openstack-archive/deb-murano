features:
  - Added Support for application deployment across OpenStack regions.
    Now, all OpenStack resource classes inherit from ``io.murano.CloudResource``
    that provides ``.getRegion()`` method and ``regionName`` property.
    This allows to assign resources
    to different regions. ``.getRegion()`` returns ``io.murano.CloudRegion``
    instance that resource or its parent belongs to. ``CloudRegion`` has
    interface similar to ``Environment`` class and is the correct way to
    get ``HeatStack`` instance associated with the region,
    default network configuration, security
    group manager and agent listener instances. ``Environment`` now acts as
    default region so backward compatibility is not broken. However new
    applications should not use environment to set security group rules but
    rather a region(s) of their instance(s) in order to work correctly when
    their instances were configured to use region other than the default.
