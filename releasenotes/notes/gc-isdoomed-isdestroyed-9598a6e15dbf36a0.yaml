features:
  - io.murano.system.GC.isDoomed() static method was added. It can be used
    within the ``.destroy`` method to test if other object is also going to be
    destroyed.
  - io.murano.system.GC.isDestroyed() static method was added. It checks if
    the object is destroyed and thus no methods can be invoked on it.
