features:
  - Added an overload of the new function - ``new($model, $owner)``.
    It loads complete object graph in a single call. Objects in the model
    can have cross references. In that case, this is the only way to instantiate
    the graph. Objects might be specified either in object model format (with
    '?' attribute or in MuranoPL format (used for Meta definitions).
  - The contract ``class()`` now uses the same approach to load classes from
    dictionaries. Thus the same two syntaxes apply there as well.
