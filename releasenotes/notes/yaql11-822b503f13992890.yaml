features:
  - Murano was migrated to yaql 1.1
  - New format MuranoPL/1.3 can be specified in manifest files.
    MuranoPL/1.3 is identical to MuranoPL/1.2 but except for the fact
    that MuranoPL/1.3 packages cannot be imported to earlier Murano versions.
    Thus applications that use new features of yaql 1.1 should use this format
    version.
