    Added the capability to declare MuranoPL YAML methods with variable length
    positional and keyword arguments. This is done using argument ``Usage``
    attribute. Regular arguments have Standard usage which is the default.
    Variable length args (args in Python) should have "Usage: VarArgs" and
    keyword args (kwargs) are declared with "Usage: KwArgs". Inside the
    method they are seen as a list and a dictionary correspondingly. For such
    arguments contracts are written for individual argument values thus
    no need to write them as lists/dicts.
