features:
  - Added the ``api_workers`` option to ``murano`` config group. It controls
    the number of API workers launched by murano. If not set, it would default to
    the number of CPUs available.

deprecations:
  - Renamed the ``workers`` option from the ``engine`` group
    to ``engine_workers`` to reduce ambiguity with the ``api_workers`` option.
