features:
  - Added ability to extend MuranoPL entities with custom metadata.
  - >
    For MuranoPL classes new key "Usage" was added. By default it is "Class".
    But it can also be "Meta" to define meta-class. Meta-class has all the
    capabilities of regular classes and in addition has 3 new attributes:
    Cardinality, Applies and Inherited.
  - It is possible to attach meta-class instances to packages,
    classes (including other meta-classes), properties, methods and
    method arguments. Each of them got new "Meta" key containing
    list (or single scalar) of meta-class instances.
