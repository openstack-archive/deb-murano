    New method type: extension methods. Extension methods enable you to "add"
    methods to existing types without modifying the original type.
    Extension methods are a special kind of static method, but they are called
    as if they were instance methods on the extended type.
    Extension methods are identified by "Usage: Extension" and the type
    they extend is determined by their first argument contract. Thus
    such methods must have at lease one parameter.
  - >
    New type-level keyword "Import" which can be either list or scalar
    that specifies type names which extensions methods should be imported
    into class context and thus become available to type members.
