features:
  - Introduced a new MuranoPL class ``io.murano.system.GC``
    Now MuranoPL garbage collector can be used to
    set up destruction dependencies between murano objects.
    If object Foo is subscribed to object Bar's destruction,
    it will be notified through a specific handler. If both
    Foo and Bar are going to be destroyed during one execution session,
    Foo will be destroyed after Bar.
    You can omit the handler, in this case destruction order will also
    be preserved. Handler can be a static or a usual function.
