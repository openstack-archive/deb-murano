features:
  - New on-request garbage collector for MuranoPL objects were implemented.
    Garbage collection is triggered by io.murano.system.GC.collect()
    static method. Garbage collector destroys all object that are not
    reachable anymore. GC can handle objects with cross-references and
    isolated object graphs. When portion of object model becomes not
    reachable it destroyed in predictable order such that child objects get
    destroyed before their parents and, when possible, before objects
    that are subscribed to their destruction notifications.
  - Internally, both pre-deployment garbage collection (that was done by
    comparision of ``Objects`` and ``ObjectsCopy``) and post-deployment
    orphan object collection are now done through the new GC.
