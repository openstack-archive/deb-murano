features:
  - Changed the type representation in object model. Previous format was
    to have three attributes in "?" section of the object - type, classVersion
    and package where only the "type" is mandatory. Now they are merged into
    single attribute "type" that has a format ``typeName/version@package``.
    Version and package parts are still optional.
upgrades:
  - Any of the tools, that inspected object model should be updated to expect
    new object format representation ``typeName/version@package``
