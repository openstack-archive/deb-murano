features:
  - Now it is possible to have several classes in one YAML file.
    Classes are separated using YAML document separator (3 dashes).
    Empty documents are skipped. If the class doesn't have Namespace
    section corresponding section from the previous class in the same
    file is used. Thus it is possible to declare namespace prefixes once
    at the file header. Even if there are several classes in one file all of
    them are still required to be declared in manifest file.
