features:
  - Now all native MuranoPL methods (those that are written in Python)
    have "?muranoMethod" metadata key referring to MuranoMethod instance for
    the method.
fixes:
  - It was impossible to explicitly provide attribute owner class to
    getAttr/setAttr methods without using namespace prefix or if the type was
    not from the core library.
