features:
  - Murano engine is now capable of caching packages on disk for reuse.
    This is controlled by `packages_cache` directory path and
    `enable_packages_cache` boolean parameter (true by default).
    The packages are cached in a eventlet/inter-process safe manner
    and are cleaned up as soon as newer
    version of the package becomes available
    (unless it's used by ongoing deployment)
