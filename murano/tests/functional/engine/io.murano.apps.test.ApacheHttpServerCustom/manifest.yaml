Description: |
 The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an
 open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and
 Windows NT. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and
 extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP
 standards.
 Apache httpd has been the most popular web server on the Internet since
 April 1996, and celebrated its 17th birthday as a project this February.
