Import an application package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways of importing an application package into
murano:

#. At this step, the package is already uploaded. If necessary,
   verify and update the information about the package, then
   click **Next**.
#. Optional: choose one or multiple categories from
   the **Application Category** menu and click the **Create** button.

.. note::
  Though specifying a category is optional, we recommend that you
  specify at least one. It helps to filter applications in the
  catalog.

  appears at the top right corner when the application is successfully
  downloaded.
