Import an application package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways of importing an application package into
murano:

* :ref:`from a zip file <ui_zip>`
* :ref:`from murano applications repository <ui_repo>`
* :ref:`from bundles of applications <ui_bundles>`

.. _ui_zip:

.zip file:

#. In OpenStack dashboard, navigate to
   :menuselection:`Murano > Manage > Package Definitions`.

   page.

   from the :guilabel:`Application Category` menu. You can select
   multiple categories while holding down the :kbd:`Ctrl` key. If
   necessary, verify and update the information about the package,
   then click the :guilabel:`Create` button.

  Though specifying a category is optional, we recommend that you
  specify at least one. It helps to filter applications in the
  catalog.

  is successfully uploaded. In case of a failure, you will see a red
  message with the problem description. For more information, please
  refer to the logs.

Search for an application in the catalog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you have imported many applications and want to quickly find
a required one, you can filter them by category, tags and words that
the application name or description contains:

In dashboard, navigate to :menuselection:`Murano > Application Catalog
> Applications`.

The page is divided into two sections:

* **Recent Activity** shows the most recently imported or deployed
  applications.

* The bottom section contains all the available applications sorted
  alphabetically.

To view all the applications of a specific category, select it from
the :guilabel:`App Category` drop-down list:

  .. image:: figures/app_category.png

     :width: 630 px

To filter applications by tags or words from the application name or
description, use the rightmost filter:

.. note::

   Tags can be specified during the import of an application package.

For example, there is an application that has the word
*community-developed* in description. Let's find it with the filter.
The following screenshot shows you the result.
