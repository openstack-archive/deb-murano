===============================
Welcome to Murano Documentation
===============================

**Murano** is an open source OpenStack project that
combines an application catalog with versatile
tooling to simplify and accelerate packaging and
deployment. It can be used with almost any application
and service in OpenStack.

Murano project consists of several source code repositories:

* `murano`_ - is the main repository. It contains code for Murano API server,
  Murano engine and MuranoPL.
* `murano-agent`_ - agent which runs on guest VMs and executes deployment
  plan.
* `murano-dashboard`_ - Murano UI implemented as a plugin for OpenStack
  Dashboard.
* `python-muranoclient`_ - Client library and CLI client for Murano.

This documentation guides application developers
through the process of composing an application
package to get it ready for uploading to Murano.

Besides the deployment rules and requirements,
it contains information on how to manage images,
categories, and repositories using the murano client that
will surely be helpful for cloud administrators.

It also explains to end users how they can use the catalog
directly from the dashboard. These include guidance on how
to manage applications and environments.

And it provides information on how to contribute to the project.

.. note::
   `Deploying Murano` and `Contibuting` guides are under development
   at the moment. The most recently updated information is published
   as the :ref:`BETA version of the Murano documentation <content>`.
