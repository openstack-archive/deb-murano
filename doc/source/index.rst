==================
Welcome to Murano!
==================

Introduction
============

Murano Project introduces an application catalog, which allows application
developers and cloud administrators to publish various cloud-ready applications
in a browsable categorised catalog. It may be used by the cloud users
(including the unexperienced ones) to pick-up the needed applications and
services and composes the reliable environments out of them in a
"push-the-button" manner.

Key goal is to provide UI and API which allows to compose and deploy composite
environments on the Application abstraction level and then manage their
lifecycle.

Murano consists of three source code repositories:
    * `murano`_ - is the main repository. It contains code for Murano API
      server, Murano engine and MuranoPL
    * `murano-agent`_ - agent which runs on guest VMs and executes deployment
      plan
    * `murano-dashboard`_ - Murano UI implemented as a plugin for OpenStack
      Dashboard
