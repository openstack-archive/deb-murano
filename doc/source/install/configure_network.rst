Network Configuration
---------------------

Murano may work in various networking environments and is capable to detect the
current network configuration and choose the appropriate settings automatically.
However, some additional actions are required to support advanced scenarios.


Nova network support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nova Network is simplest networking solution, which has limited capabilities
but is available on any OpenStack deployment without the need to deploy any
additional components.

When a new Murano Environment is created, Murano checks if a dedicated
networking service (i.e. Neutron) exists in the current OpenStack deployment.
It relies on Keystone's service catalog for that.
If such a service is not present, Murano automatically falls back to Nova
Network. No further configuration is needed in this case, all the VMs spawned
by Murano will be joining the same Network.

Neutron support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If Neutron is installed, Murano enables its advanced networking features that
give you ability to not care about configuring networks for your application.

By default it will create an isolated network for each environment and join
all VMs needed by your application to that network. To install and configure application in
just spawned virtual machine Murano also requires a router connected to the external network.


Automatic Neutron network configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create router automatically, provide the following parameters in config file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [networking]

    external_network = %EXTERNAL_NETWORK_NAME%
    router_name = %MURANO_ROUTER_NAME%
    create_router = true

..

To figure out the name of the external network, perform the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    openstack network list --external

During the first deploy, required networks and router with specified name will be created and set up.

Manual neutron network configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Step 1. Create public network

 * First, you need to check for existence of external networks. Login as admin and go to
   *Project -> Network -> Network Topology*. And check network type in network details at *Admin -> Networks -> Network name* page.
   The same action can be done via CLI by running `openstack network list --external`. To create new external network examine `OpenStack documentation <http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/openstack.html#openstack-network-create>`_.

* Step 2. Create local network

 * Go to *Project -> Network -> Networks*.
 * Click *Create Network* and fill the form.

* Step 3. Create router

 * Go to *Project -> Network -> Routers*

 * Click "Create Router"
 * In the "Router Name" field, enter the *murano-default-router*

  If you specify a name other than *murano-default-router*, it will be necessary to change the following settings in the config file:

  .. code-block:: ini

     [networking]

     router_name = %SPECIFIED_NAME%
     create_router = false


 * Click on the specified router name
 * In the opened view click “Add interface”
 * Specify the subnet and IP address

  And check the result in `Network Topology` tab.
