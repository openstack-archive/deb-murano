Name: DummySecurityGroupManager
Extends: SecurityGroupManager

# This class actually adds nothing to the base SecurityGroupManager,
# so a base class could be used instead. However, it's better to explicitly
# declare this class and use it, since the base one is supposed to remain
# "abstract" and never be instantiated.
